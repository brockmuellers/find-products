# find-products

I want to know when products that I'm interested in become available on the REI used gear website. This could be applied to other websites too.

Right now this doesn't take into account product color, condition, or any attribute that wasn't specifically in the search query.

It also doesn't compare the results it finds to previous results, which is a very important feature. I need to add that.
